# About Me

Hi, my name is **Brody White** and I'm excited to start my journey in tech! I've spent the last five years in non profit fundraising in events. First with [The American Diabetes Association](https://www.diabetes.org) then with [March of Dimes](https://www.marchofdimes.org/). I spend most of my time with my dog Winfield and my cat Jeri. I love performing arts, especially dance, and teach and take class as often as I can. I also love to spend time working out!
