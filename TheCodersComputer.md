# The Coder's Computer

Text editors are what software developers used to write code. Every computer comes with text editors already installed. However most developers will download a third party text editor with more features, many of which are free to download. A text editor is used largely just to create the text used when coding. An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a platform that includes multiple software like a text editor a debugger and other features all combined into one!
