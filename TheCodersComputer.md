# The Coder's Computer

Text editors are what software developers used to write code. Computers can come with text editors already installed. However most developers will download a third party text editor with more features, many of which are free to download. A text editor is used largely just to create the text used when coding. An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a platform that includes multiple software like a text editor a debugger and other features all combined into one! 

When setting up a Mac for coding we started by using the terminal, a command line app used to control and make changes to the computer's operating system. The first step was installing Hombrew, a free program used to install apps through the terminal. Next I chose to download VS Code as my text editor. As I mentioned before, there are lots of editors to choose from but this was what I picked based on the class suggestion. We then also installed Git to help track changes to files. Node was added for work on Javascript and NPM added to be able to install programs to expand node. ESLint helps to identify problems in Javascript code and allow the coder to resolve them. Last we added Tree, is a command to see all directories and folders and how they connect to eachother. Like a family tree of your system!
