# Learning Markdown

Markdown is what we use in Github to edit webpages, like our learning journals. After creating your main page with Markdown, it can be used to stylize text like bolding or creating italics. It can also be used to add images or create links to outside websites or other pages you've created yourself. 

You can see this page there is are a list of links at the bottom that you can jump through different assignments I've worked on. Each page built is under one repository and can all be linked together after separetly built. Those links were put in a list using Markdown, and even the top of this page uses Markdown headers!
