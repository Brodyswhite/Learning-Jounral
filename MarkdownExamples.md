# Growth Mindset 

A Growth Mindset is a progressive thought process that best helps someone learn. Someone with a Growth Mindset will take accountability and make changes to best learn and grow. The opposite is a Fixed Minset. A Fixed Mindset refuses to change and haults learning to stay the same. Allowing for a Growth Mindset will challenge the student to push forward and make changes to be the best student possible and get the most from their experiences. To best take advantage of these lessons I will keep a Growth Mindset by:


  - Embrace challenges 
  - Keep pushing through obstacles
  - Keep up a maximum effort
  - Accept criticisms 
  - Be inspired by the success of others
